# NestJs DTO

## Data Transfer Object

A DTO is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network

Do not have any behavior except for storage, retrieval, serialization and deserialization of its own data

Result in increased performance

Can be useful for data validation

## DTO could be used interface or class to be defined

**however, it's better to use class to defined because interface could not be refered in runtime**
